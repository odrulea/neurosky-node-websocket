neurosky-node-websocket
=======================

Using Neurosky's Mindwave Mobile EEG headset, expose live data with WebSocket and view live stream in browser with HTML &amp; Javscript.

# Prerequisites

1. get the project files from git into a local working directory
2. you will need a Mindwave Mobile headset, sold by Neurosky -> http://store.neurosky.com/
3. you will need Neurosky's "ThinkGear Connector" (TGC) installed and running on your machine to receive signal from your headset ->  http://developer.neurosky.com/docs/doku.php?id=thinkgear_connector_tgc
make sure you are able to start the connector and see signal strength indicator working with your headset
4. you will need node.js installed on your machine -> http://nodejs.org/
5. installing node also installs node package manager (npm). on command line, use npm to install the two required node packages:
```
npm install node-neurosky
```
```
npm install ws
```
More info on these packages here:
node-neurosky -> https://www.npmjs.org/package/node-neurosky
websocket -> https://github.com/einaros/ws

# Getting Started

1. turn on your Mindwave Mbile headset and connect to the ThinkGear Connector app on your machine
2. from command line, go to root level of your local working directory
3. start the node server
```
node ./node/app.js
```
you should see streaming data from the headset output on the command line
if you see the following data, it indicates no connection:
```
{ poorSignalLevel: 200 }
{ poorSignalLevel: 200 }
{ poorSignalLevel: 200 }
...
```
it can take up to 30 seconds for the headset to connect, so if you see the poorSignalLevel, just give it a moment to connect
4. in your local working directory, open up ./connect.html with your web browser (Chrome or Firefox recommended)
5. if you are in FF or Chrome, open up Firebug or Web Developer Tools (respectively) and open the "Console" tab to view debugging messages
6. on the web page, click the big "Connect" button in the upper left.  this will connect to the locally running websocket server. in the web browser's console, will see connection messages.
7. once connection is successful, data will begin streaming in the graph
